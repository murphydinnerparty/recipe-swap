        "Then using a spatula, carefully lift the edge of the omelette and push the large curds that begin to form towards the middle of the pan, allowing the raw egg to take its place and cook.",
        "Sprinkle the cheese over the omelette.",

        "When it`s hot, pour  a ladle of the omelette mix/batter into the pan, and allow to settle for a few seconds.",
        "Whirl it around at the outset so that it is evenly distributed",
        "Then, within a few seconds, place the equivalent of one slice of cheese (the ones you have already cut up in squares) these will most likely begin to `melt` within a minute or so."

        "Nutritional yeast is a great replacement for a cheese taste!",
        "Add onions or mushrooms for a more hearty taste!"
